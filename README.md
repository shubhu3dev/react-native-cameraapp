# react-native-cameraapp
A react native application using the react-native-camera module to use the camera and how you can load images from the state.

The components we use in the project are -
1. View
2. StyleSheet
3. StatusBar
4. TouchableOpacity
5. Image
6. Button
 
# we have also use two third party libries namely
1. RNCamera from 'react-native-camera' - To use camera module and,
2. Icon from 'react-native-vector-icons/FontAwesome - To use camera icons

<h4>We have also used the State Hook â€“ React in order to handle state or can say how we can load images form state.</h4>
